Let's make it a cheat sheet for Machine Learning!

Topic to discuss
  - baysian: probability based on events already happened.
  - generative model:
  - intrinsic dimension
  - regression: how is regulated regression regulated? what is lasso?
  - what is perceptron? is it similar to other neural network framework? or is it unique in someway?
  - some detail math problem in SVM(how to find w, xi(slack), and alpha)
  
 
  - What is the difference between gradient boosted trees and random forest? Which is more approprite for what kind of situations?
  - What is entropy? Briefly go through different ways of measuring error rate. Gini...

1. Sharing: Programming Assignment 5 solution
2. PCA Revisited: Programming assignment 4, notebook 6, how could we tear apart spatial and temporal effects?
3. light on bays therom and conditional probability. Take the example of tossing a dice.
